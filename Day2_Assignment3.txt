SELECT * FROM bookings

WHERE doctor_id = ?

AND appointment_date >= ?

AND appointment_date <= ?;

Propose a composite index
Explain column order choice.

answer:
-> composite index can be on doctor_id and appointment_date: 
	 CREATE INDEX idx ON bookings (doctor_id, appointment_date);
	 
-> equality conditions comes first and then the range conditions. searching for doctor id first narrows down the search and then we can select for range of appointment dates secondly.
